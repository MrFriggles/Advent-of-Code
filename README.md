# Advent Of Code
Template repository. Can be copied to make your own Cpp CMake built advent of code repository.

## How to build
Once the repository has been cloned and entered:
```
cmake -S . -B ./build
make -C ./build
```
From there, the executable `aoc` will be built. Adjust IDE settings accordingly.

## Usage
```
# aoc [-d/--day=<day> | -a/--all]
```

   - Why did I decide to randomly start on day 14? Who knows!
